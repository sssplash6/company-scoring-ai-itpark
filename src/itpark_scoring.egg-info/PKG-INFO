# IT Park Company Scoring (AI-Only MVP)

This is a local desktop app that accepts a company name, collects **public web data**, and produces a **scorecard + PDF/CSV/Excel** using an LLM. The API key is **required** and **not** stored. Users can select which criteria to include.

## What this does
- Collects public info (company website, public pages, review sites, job postings, news mentions).
- Extracts structured signals and scores companies using an LLM with coverage + confidence.
- Exports PDF/CSV/Excel.

## What this does NOT do
- It does **not** scrape sites that forbid automation (e.g., LinkedIn/Apollo). If you want that data, add manual inputs or approved APIs.
- It does **not** store API keys.

## Quick start (dev)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -m itpark_scoring.app
```

## Windows .exe build (PyInstaller)
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --name itpark-scoring --add-data "src/itpark_scoring/assets;itpark_scoring/assets" src/itpark_scoring/app.py
```

## Configuration
- Enter your API key in the UI. The key is required, held in memory only, and cleared when the app exits.

## Data and compliance
- The collector respects robots.txt where possible. If a site disallows crawling, it is skipped.
- Always review each target site's Terms of Service.

## Notes
- The rubric is intentionally broad and includes objective criteria with confidence and coverage.
